= DB-DWH docker image repository

The parts of the project can be divided into several parts, complementing each other.
Basically, there are 2 groups of images:

* *parent (base image)* - these are the docker images
that are used as base images for the target products.
They can only contain the absolutely necessary functionality and content.
* *builder* - they are used to carry content, they
should never be used for base image.
Its function is in the multi-stage dockerfile,
where it is used as driver storage for example.
